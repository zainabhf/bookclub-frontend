## INTRODUCTION
#### book club is a friendly website that gathers some books as cards, each card contains the book poster and the title. Also, when anyone clicks on the book it will transfer to the book details that contain the author name, book description, number of pages, and publishing date. However, it’s able for the user to view and add reviews for each book. Moreover, the user can edit or delete his/her review. On the other hand, the user can add books and only edit books that he/she added and can control his/her profile by editing the name, image, and changing the password but he/she can’t edit the Email Address for user protection issue .
Finally, only the admin can add, edit and delete any book or review.
